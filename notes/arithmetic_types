integers:

each integer type represents a finite range of integers.

Signed integer: negative, zero, positive

unsigned ints: zero or positive

Representation

Representing signed integer types is more 
complicated that representing unsigned integer 
types. Historically, the C language has
supported three signed integer representation
schemes:

Sign and magnitude:
the high-order bit indicates the sign, and the 
remaining bits represent the magnitude of the value in pure binary notation.

Ones' complement:
The sign bit is given the weight -((2**N-1)-1)
and the other value bits have the same weights
as for unsigned.

Twos complement:
The sign bit is given the weight -(2**N-1) and
the other value bits have the same weights as for unsigned.
